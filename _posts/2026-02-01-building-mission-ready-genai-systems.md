title: "Building Mission-Ready GenAI Systems"

GenAI is now mature enough for high-stakes environments, but only when reliability, security, and governance are built in from day one. In this site, I will share practical patterns for delivering production-grade systems that survive real-world constraints.

Key themes you will see in future posts:

- Secure, auditable RAG pipelines for sensitive data.
- Agentic workflows that improve operational throughput without sacrificing controls.
- LLMOps practices that keep performance stable in regulated environments.
- Evaluation strategies that move beyond toy benchmarks.

If you are working on mission-critical systems, follow along as I publish monthly updates.
